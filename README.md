# NinjaPlatformer
This is a 2D platformer  project for my STEP academy C++ course graduation. (works in progress)
<br /><br />
I was using Visual Studio 2017 Community, so this project is targeted to v141 Build tools.
<br /><br />
This has been created with SDL2, OpenGL and Box2D libraries.
<br /><br />
<b/>/Angine</b> - the game engine folder.<br />
Here is all the interesting stuff about "inside working".
<br /><br />
<b>/libs</b> - dependencies folder. <br />
The solution is set to get all the includes from "$(SolutionDir)/libs/include"<br /> and the libraries from "$(SolutionDir)/libs/lib"
<br /><br />
<b>/NinjaPlatformer</b> - the actual game folder. <br />
All the game physics and mechanics are in here.
